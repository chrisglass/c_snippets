C Snippets
==========

This is (or will be) a list of various algorithms I implemented for kicks, in
C. They are most probably not the best or most efficient implementations
around, but they should work :)

Since I'm really dumb and tend to forget stuff I don't need to remember, I'll
try to comment the code well enough for me to understand after a few months. If
I remember to.

I hope it serves some purpose to someone
